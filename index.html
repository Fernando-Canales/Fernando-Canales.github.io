								<b>Education:</b> I have a bachelors degree in physics from the University of Guanjuato and a Masters

								<b>Research Interests:</b> I am interested in exoplanet discovery and characterisation. My current work is focused

								<b>PLATO Double-aperture Photometry</b><br>Detecting false planetary transtis is a crucial task for every transit survery. 
								Aperture photometry is vastly used in space telescopes as a way to extract transit light curves on-board. However, using a single
								aperture is not enough to see if the produced light curve is actually planetary. Therefore, using a second aperture could be helpful
								for A considerable part of my work is devoted to test
