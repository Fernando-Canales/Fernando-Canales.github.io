								<b>Education:</b> I have a Physics degree from the University of Guanjuato and a Master's degree in Science (Astrophysics)
								 from the Astronomy Department of the same University. I recently completed my PhD in Astrophysics. It took place 
								 in two different institutions: the Laboratoire d'Instumentation et de Recherche en Astrophysique <a href="https://lira.observatoiredeparis.psl.eu/">(LIRA)</a> at the Meudon site of Paris Observatory
								and the Max-Planck-Institut für Sonnensystemforschung <a href="https://www.mps.mpg.de/en">(MPS)</a> in Göttingen. 
							</p>

					
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b> I am interested in exoplanet discovery and characterisation. My <a href="https://cyu.hal.science/tel-05165095/">PhD work</a> was focused
								on the use the so called double aperture photometry for correctly discarding
								false planetary transits for the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Plato">PLATO space mission</a>.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Current Interests:</b> I am currently looking for data science opportunities in the industry. I am particularly interested in
								applying my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to solve real-world problems. 
								I am open to roles that allow me to leverage my expertise in Python, R, and SQL for data-driven decision-making.
								I am also interested in exploring my creative side through writing, wether it be blogs, poetry or fiction. I love journaling and reading

								<b>PLATO Double-aperture Photometry</b><br>Detecting false planetary transtis is a crucial task for every transit survery. 
								Aperture photometry is vastly used in space telescopes as a way to extract transit light curves on-board. However, using a single
								aperture is not enough to see if the produced light curve is actually planetary. Therefore, using a second aperture could be helpful
								for a considerable part of PLATO target stars. A significant part of my work during my PhD was devoted to testing this technique.
